## App Brainstorming
Favorite Apps:
1. Structured
   - The quick add function to add your task to your schedule that is intuitive.
   - The option to include a to-do list/checklist

2. Apple Music
   - The option to play a song next (play next) and add to queue features
   - Editing a playlists cover to your own image
  
3. Snapchat
   - Adding temporary stories for your friends to view for 24 hours
   - The save in chat feature
   - Memories that show older images from previous snaps

My App Idea:
My app idea, (MoodGroove, for now) is a mood-tracking and journaling app that uses music to track emotional well-being. Each day, the app allows users to track their mood and select a song that best represents their mood. It would include a journaling feature for users to journal maybe while listening to the music. Another feature I could include is for the app to generate a playlist either tailored to users mood or, offer to generate a "mood-altering" playlists if they want to change their mood or prefer a playlist based on a different mood. For possible improvements, or additional features, users can invite friends also on the app to “Listening Rooms” where a designated “DJ” controls the music. The app would also provide a weekly summary, to show the trends and favorite songs in a format similar to Snapchat’s Memories feature. This essentially aims to help users track and understand their emotional states over time and feel more control in their mental health journey.
